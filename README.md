# Ludo — Static Web App (MIT)

This is a robust, client-side Ludo game built as a static web application suitable for deployment on GitHub Pages.

- Tech: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no server required)
- License: MIT
- Email of author: student@example.com

What you get
- An interactive 4-player Ludo-style board with a dice roller
- Turn-based gameplay with simple capture rules (knock opponents back to home)
- All code is contained in a small, portable static site you can drop into a GitHub Pages repo

How to run
- Create a GitHub repository
- Push these files at the repository root
- In GitHub Pages, enable Pages from the main branch (or docs folder) – then the site will be available at https://<you>.github.io/<repo>/

Notes
- This is a self-contained educational implementation aimed at demonstrating static web app architecture and basic game logic.
- If you need a fully polished release, consider extending with more artwork, audio, and additional rules.
